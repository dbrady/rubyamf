there are a few top level variables you will want to know about that you can use in services.

RUBYAMF_ROOT 			#maps to the rubyamf directory
RUBYAMF_CORE 			#which maps to the rubyamf_core directory
RUBYAMF_SERVICES 	#maps to the rubyamf/services directory
RUBYAMF_PUBLIC 		#maps to the rubyamf/public directory
RUBYAMF_HELPERS 	#maps to the rubyamf/services/rubyamf/helpers directory
RUBYAMF_VO 				#maps to the rubyamf/services/vo directory

These are good to use when loading files, especially if you are requiring rubygems anywhere.
rubygems spams the load path $:. So lots of times if you dont use one of these predefined vars
an exception will be raised saying it cant find the file to load.
